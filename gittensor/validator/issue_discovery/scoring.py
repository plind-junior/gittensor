"""Shared issue-discovery scoring helpers.

The legacy timeline-scraping path (``score_discovered_issues``,
``_collect_issues_from_prs``, ``_merge_scan_issues``, ``scan_closed_issues``)
has been removed — unreliable solver detection was the original motivator for
migrating issue discovery to the mirror. The functions here are the math-only
helpers still used by ``issue_discovery.scan``: the review-quality multiplier,
open-issue spam threshold, credibility formula, and per-repo eligibility gate.
